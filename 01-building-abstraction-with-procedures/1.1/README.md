# The Elements of Programming

- primitive expressions
- means of combination
- means of abstraction

## Expressions

- lisp uses prefix notation for expressions

```
486
> 486

(+ 137 349)
> 486
```

## Naming and the Environment

```lisp
(define size 2)
```

It should be clear that the possiblity of associating values with symbols and later retriving them
means that the interpreter must maintain some sort of memory that keep track of name object pairs.
This memory is called the *environment*.

This is $x^3$
this is $$x^3$$
